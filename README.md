# ProjectArduinoDue
There is a stabilization to complete with remarks from the past issues with the mock-up and also the prototype with a gyrometer from SSS in the UK.

The algorithm is running now on, but the sofware with the Arduino Due compiles on a PC with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, so that I should be root to run it.

First of all a mock-up with a stabilization has been proven the concept then a two dimensionnal prototype has been constructed to test the cinematic chain of it.
