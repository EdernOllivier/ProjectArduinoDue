# ProjectArduinoDue
There is a stabilization to complete with remarks from the past issues with the mock-up and also the prototype with a gyrometer from SSS in the UK.

The algorithm is running now on, but the sofware with the Arduino Due compiles on a PC with the Mint Linux distribution, so that I should be root to run it.
